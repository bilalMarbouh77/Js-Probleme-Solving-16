Question:

Write a function that determines if a number is 

a narcissistic number (also known as an Armstrong 

number). A narcissistic number is a number that 

is equal to the sum of its own digits, 

each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Examples:

narcissistic(153)  
// Output: true  
// Explanation: 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153  

narcissistic(9474)  
// Output: true  
// Explanation: 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 9474  

narcissistic(487)  
// Output: false  
// Explanation: 4³ + 8³ + 7³ ≠ 487
